Last month, I wrote about [securing your email with GPG encryption](/posts/email-security-for-writers/). Today, I want to discuss another essential tool in a writer's security toolkit: Signal, the encrypted messaging app that has become the gold standard for confidential communications.

## When Text Messages Become Headlines

A vivid illustration of how even secure channels can be compromised through human error was recently documented in [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/). A journalist recounted how Trump administration officials, intending to discuss sensitive "war plans" using Signal, inadvertently included the journalist in their encrypted group chat.

The error occurred because Congressman Mike Waltz had saved Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in his contacts by initials only. This seemingly minor contact management oversight led to a significant security breach when Waltz intended to message a different "JG" in his contact list.

This accidental inclusion provided the author with direct, unintended access to internal discussions. The incident serves as a stark reminder of several key points:

1. Operational security relies heavily on careful user practices, regardless of the technology used.
2. Human error, like adding the wrong recipient, can undermine the security assumptions of any communication channel.
3. Proper contact management is essential—abbreviated or incomplete contact names create serious security risks.

Even though the officials were using Signal's strong encryption, the simple mistake of having ambiguous contacts completely bypassed all technical protections. This core lesson about recipient management applies universally to all communication platforms. We must remain vigilant about *who* we are communicating with, not just how secure the channel is.

## Why Signal Stands Apart

As writers, we often handle sensitive information—unpublished drafts, source quotes, client feedback, or confidential research. Just as we [protect our Git commits](/posts/implementing-signed-commits/) and [encrypt our emails](/posts/email-security-for-writers/), we need to secure our instant communications. Signal is specifically designed for this purpose.

Signal offers several advantages that make it particularly valuable for writers:

    G([Disappearing Messages]) -->|Provides| H([Automatic deletion after specified time])
    I([Screen Security]) -->|Prevents| J([Screenshots and app content in recent apps])
{{< /mermaid >}}

Security expert [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/) has noted that Signal's protocol is "one of the best-designed and best-implemented encryption systems we have." This is why journalists, lawyers, activists, and yes, even government officials trying to avoid leaks, rely on it daily. Privacy advocate [Moxie Marlinspike](https://twitter.com/moxie), the founder of Signal, has consistently championed user privacy above all else.

## The Signal Difference: A Technical Comparison

Let's compare Signal to other popular messaging platforms:

{{< mermaid >}}
graph LR
    A[Signal] -->|End-to-End Encryption| B[Always enabled, minimal metadata]
    C[WhatsApp] -->|End-to-End Encryption| D[Enabled but collects metadata]
    E[iMessage] -->|End-to-End Encryption| F[Only between Apple devices]
    G[SMS/Texting] -->|No Encryption| H[Completely insecure]
    I[Facebook Messenger] -->|Optional Encryption| J[Not enabled by default]
    K[Telegram] -->|Optional Encryption| L[Only in "Secret Chats"]
{{< /mermaid >}}

According to a 2023 analysis by Tech Policy Press, the technical superiority of Signal becomes clear when we examine what happens to your message data and metadata:

1. **Signal**: Messages encrypted on your device, decrypted only on recipient's device. Signal is the only app that encrypts or doesn't store metadata like contacts, group information, and even message sender details.
2. **WhatsApp**: Uses the Signal protocol for encryption but collects extensive metadata and is owned by Meta, creating privacy concerns through its connections to other Meta services.
3. **iMessage**: Secure between Apple devices but backups may not be encrypted, and the distinction between encrypted iMessages (blue) and unencrypted SMS (green) is often misunderstood by users.
4. **SMS**: Messages transmitted in plain text, readable by carriers and potentially others (as highlighted by the Atlantic article incident).
5. **Facebook Messenger**: Messages stored on Meta's servers unless you specifically use "Secret Conversations," with confusing naming conventions that may mislead users about their security.
6. **Telegram**: Despite its reputation, regular chats are not end-to-end encrypted by default. Only "Secret Chats" offer true end-to-end encryption, and many users don't realize this distinction.

## Real-World Applications for Writers

How does this apply to your writing practice? Consider these scenarios:

### Protecting Sources

"I interview whistleblowers for investigative pieces," explains journalist Elena Rodriguez. "Signal is non-negotiable for these conversations. Its disappearing message feature ensures that sensitive information doesn't persist longer than necessary." This sentiment is echoed by investigative journalist [Barton Gellman](https://bsky.app/profile/bartongellman.bsky.social), who has written extensively about surveillance and security.

### Client Communications

Technical writer Marcus Chen shares: "When discussing proprietary software features with clients, I use Signal. It gives them confidence that competitors won't intercept details about upcoming products."

### Collaborative Writing

"Our writing team is distributed across three continents," says editor Priya Sharma. "Signal group chats let us discuss sensitive editorial decisions without worrying about our communications being monitored or leaked."

## Setting Up Signal: A Quick Guide

Getting started with Signal is straightforward:

1. **Download**: Install [Signal](https://signal.org/download/) from your device's app store
2. **Verify**: Register with your phone number and verify with a code
3. **Secure**: Set up a PIN and enable registration lock
4. **Configure**: Adjust disappearing message defaults and other security settings

For maximum security, consider these additional steps:

## Beyond the Basics: Signal's Advanced Features

Signal offers several features particularly useful for writers:

### Note to Self

The "Note to Self" chat allows you to send encrypted notes, documents, and media files to yourself—perfect for transferring sensitive drafts between devices without using less secure methods like email.

### View-Once Media

When sharing sensitive documents or images with sources or clients, the "view-once" feature ensures they're automatically deleted after being viewed.

### Secure Groups

Signal groups allow for encrypted collaboration with multiple team members, with all the security benefits of individual chats.

### Desktop Application

Signal's desktop application makes it convenient to communicate securely while writing on your computer, with all messages still encrypted end-to-end.

## The Limitations: What Signal Can't Protect Against

While Signal provides excellent technical protection, it's important to understand its limitations:

1. **Device Security**: If your phone or computer is compromised, your Signal messages could be exposed
2. **Human Factors**: As the incident reported in *The Atlantic* showed, adding the wrong person to any conversation bypasses all technical protections
3. **Legal Compulsion**: In some jurisdictions, you could be legally compelled to unlock your device
4. **Screenshots**: While Signal can block screenshots on Android, it cannot prevent all forms of message capture
5. **User Error**: As the Atlantic article demonstrated, even Signal's perfect encryption is useless if you add the wrong person to your conversation
6. **Contact Management**: Abbreviated or ambiguous contact names (like using only initials) can lead to messaging the wrong person
7. **Security Folklore**: A 2023 Tech Policy Press report identified widespread "security folklore" - beliefs about app security that aren't grounded in fact but nonetheless guide user decisions
8. **Security Nihilism**: The same report found many users experience "security nihilism," a debilitating sense that truly secure communication is impossible

As [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/) reminds us, "Security is a process, not a product." Signal is a powerful tool, but it must be part of a broader security mindset. Security researcher [Matt Blaze](https://bsky.app/profile/mattblaze.bsky.social) has written extensively about these limitations in his [Substack newsletter](https://mattblaze.org/).

## Integrating Signal Into Your Writing Workflow

Based on my experience, conversations with other writers, and recent research from Tech Policy Press, here's how to effectively incorporate Signal into your professional practice:

1. **Establish Signal as a preferred channel**: Let sources, clients, and collaborators know you're available on Signal for sensitive communications
2. **Create clear policies**: Decide what types of information belong on Signal versus email or other platforms
3. **Use disappearing messages appropriately**: Set expiration times based on the sensitivity of the information
4. **Verify contacts**: For highly sensitive communications, verify security numbers in person or via video call
5. **Maintain detailed contact records**: As the Waltz/Goldberg incident demonstrated, never abbreviate contact names or use initials only—each contact should have a full, unambiguous name and relevant details
6. **Regular security audits**: Periodically review your Signal contacts and groups to ensure they're current and appropriate
7. **Customize security settings**: Take advantage of Signal's granular privacy settings to tailor the app to your specific needs
8. **Avoid backups to unencrypted services**: Be cautious about backing up Signal messages to cloud services that might not maintain the same level of encryption
9. **Be aware of metadata**: While Signal minimizes metadata collection, understand what information might still be exposed in your communications

## Conclusion: The Writer's Security Triad

In today's digital landscape, writers need a three-pronged approach to security:

1. **Secure your content creation**: With tools like [signed Git commits](/posts/implementing-signed-commits/)
2. **Secure your formal communications**: With [email encryption](/posts/email-security-for-writers/)
3. **Secure your instant communications**: With [Signal](https://signal.org/)

This security triad protects your work, your sources, and your professional relationships throughout the writing process. Technology journalist [Runa Sandvik](https://bsky.app/profile/runasand.bsky.social), who focuses on security for journalists, has created an excellent [Substack newsletter](https://runasand.substack.com/) covering these exact topics.

A comprehensive 2023 analysis by Tech Policy Press concluded that Signal leads the way in secure messaging, particularly in its approach to metadata protection and user privacy. The report recommends that other messaging apps follow Signal's example of encrypting or not storing user metadata. As governments around the world increasingly threaten encryption with new regulations, it's crucial that writers understand and advocate for truly secure communication tools.

Signal helps provide that freedom, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your writing.
